# What does it do? 
Simple data collection tool used to log user data based on user input. 

1. Assigns user IDs that are completely unique to each user logging their data.
2. Logs all data and created user IDs to text files to ensure duplicate user IDs are not being assigned to new users.
3. All user data is logged to DATABASE.txt, this file can be found within the directory of the script. 

# Why? 
Serves no real purpose, it's really just to improve my problem solving and programming skills.
